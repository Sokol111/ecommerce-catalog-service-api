# ============================================================================
# Catalog Messaging API - AsyncAPI Specification
# ============================================================================
#
# 📌 SCHEMA-FIRST APPROACH:
#    - Avro schemas (/avro/*.avsc) are the SOURCE OF TRUTH
#    - This AsyncAPI file documents channels, operations, and event flows
#    - Payload schemas reference Avro files (no duplication)
#    - To modify event structure, edit Avro schemas only
#
# 🏗️ EVENT STRUCTURE (Metadata + Payload Pattern):
#    Each event has two top-level fields:
#    - metadata: EventMetadata (technical/observability fields)
#    - payload: Business-specific data (e.g., ProductCreatedPayload)
#
#    Benefits:
#    - Clear separation of concerns (technical vs business data)
#    - Reusable metadata across all events
#    - All data in Avro (not in Kafka headers) for reliability

info:
  title: Catalog Messaging API
  version: 1.0.1
  description: |
    AsyncAPI specification for Catalog service Kafka events.
    Events are serialized using Avro format and registered in Schema Registry.

    📌 **Schema Source of Truth**: Avro schema files in /avro directory
    This AsyncAPI document describes channels, operations, and event flows.
    Detailed payload schemas are defined in Avro files for runtime serialization.

    🏗️ **Event Structure**:
    All events follow the metadata + payload pattern:
    ```
    {
      metadata: EventMetadata,  // Technical fields (event_id, trace_id, etc.)
      payload: BusinessData      // Domain-specific data
    }
    ```

    This service publishes events for:
    - **Products** - Product lifecycle events (created, updated)
    - **Categories** - Category lifecycle events (created, updated)

channels:
  # ==================== PRODUCT EVENTS ====================
  catalog.product.events:
    address: catalog.product.events
    description: |
      Product domain events channel.
      All product lifecycle events (created, updated) are published to this single topic.
      Uses product_id as partition key to guarantee ordering for events of the same product.
    messages:
      ProductCreated:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/ProductCreated"
      ProductUpdated:

  # ==================== CATEGORY EVENTS ====================
  catalog.category.events:
    address: catalog.category.events
    description: |
      Category domain events channel.
      All category lifecycle events (created, updated) are published to this single topic.
      Uses category_id as partition key to guarantee ordering for events of the same category.
    messages:
